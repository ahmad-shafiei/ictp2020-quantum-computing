# ictp-quantum-computing
In this lab the participants will learn some basics of using qiskit python libraries for developing quantum algorithms, testing them on quantum simulators, and running the programs on publicly available superconducting quantum nodes provided by IBM Q.

QC lab outline:
1. activation of conda, installation of qiskit and jupyter notebook (see INSTALLATION file for more details)
2. warm-up: getting to know python commands and jupyter notebook environment
3. mini-lecture: how to program with qiskit
4. lab project: teleportation protocol and superdense coding
